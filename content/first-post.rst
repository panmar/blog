.. code-block:: rust

    fn main() {
        println!("Hello world!");
    }

This is my first post. Inspired by `Jakub Stasiak's blog <https://stasiak.at>`_
(I encourage you to visit it if you haven't already), I've finally decided to start my
blogging adventure. For this, I'm using `Pelican <https://github.com/getpelican/pelican>`_.
So far, it's working very nicely - I am glad I resisted the urge to roll my own solution.
I'm using modified `Jakub's theme <https://github.com/panmar/panmar.github.io>`_, which
I've been tweaking during night hours - hence the dark theme.
